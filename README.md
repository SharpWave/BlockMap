# BlockMap Project

## Overview
BlockMap is a Python project designed for processing and visualizing street networks. Utilizing powerful libraries such as GeoPandas, Shapely, NetworkX, and Matplotlib, this project allows users to analyze urban layouts and visualize street networks effectively.

## Installation
To get started with BlockMap, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install geopandas shapely networkx matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlockMap.git
   cd BlockMap
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook BlockMap.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to process and visualize the street network.

## Example
The notebook contains examples of how to load street network data, process it to extract polygons representing city blocks, and visualize the results with color intensity based on block area.
